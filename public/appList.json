    "id": 1,
    "description": "This focus app takes the proven Pomodoro technique and makes it even more practical for modern study sessions. Instead of just setting a timer, it creates a complete environment for deep focus, reducing distractions and maximizing concentration. Users can set custom work and break intervals, track completed sessions daily, and analyze detailed statistics on study habits over time. The minimal and calming design helps reduce cognitive load, allowing students to focus entirely on the task at hand. Gentle notifications indicate when to pause and resume, helping maintain a healthy rhythm between work and rest. A unique feature is the integration of task lists with timers. Each study task can be assigned to a specific Pomodoro session, structuring the schedule efficiently. Built-in analytics track both the time spent and which tasks consumed the most mental energy, enabling reflection on productivity and workflow adjustments. Optional background sounds, such as soft white noise or calming instrumental music, enhance concentration and create a distraction-free environment. For those prone to procrastination, FLIP offers motivational streaks and achievements. Completing multiple Pomodoro sessions unlocks milestones, providing a sense of accomplishment. This gamified approach makes focusing more engaging and less of a chore. Whether preparing for exams, writing assignments, or tackling complex study projects, FLIP combines focus tracking, task management, and motivational tools to keep students disciplined, refreshed, and productive throughout the day.",
